Suppose in January 2015 you had the foresight or luck to identify semiconductor stocks as the next "big play" of the decade.

So, you [invested $10,000](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/nvidia-corp-nvda-stock-investment-worth-today) in shares of Nvidia Corp. (ticker: NVDA). Fast forward to January 2025, and your investment would have compounded at an astonishing 75.6% annualized rate, ballooning to $2,849,788.40.

But this also assumes you picked the right [semiconductor stock](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/best-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy). If instead you chose Nvidia's competitor Intel Corp. ([INTC](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/intc-intel-corp)), your story would be quite different. Intel's annualized return over the same period was -2.6%, meaning your $10,000 investment would have shrunk to just $7,702.

Even if someone would have recognized the potential in Semiconductors, they should have identified the ***correct company*** to invest in.
