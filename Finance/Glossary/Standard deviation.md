Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the **volatility** or **risk** of the ETF's returns over a specific period of time.

- **Higher standard deviation** = higher volatility and risk. The price of the ETF tends to have larger ups and downs.
- **Lower standard deviation** = lower volatility and risk. The price of the ETF is more predictable and stays closer to its average return.

Investors often use standard deviation as a way to assess the risk level of an ETF relative to its potential return.

A risk-averse investor might look for ETFs with lower standard deviation.


#### Can standard deviation detect a constant uptrend
No, **standard deviation** does not directly indicate if there has been a consistent upward trend in a stock.


#### Upward trend vs Volatility
- **Stock with an upward trend but high volatility:**    
    - The stock’s price is generally increasing over time (upward trend), but it jumps up and down a lot within each period.
    - It would have a **high standard deviation** because of the volatility, even though the general trend is positive.

- **Stock with an upward trend but low volatility:**
    - The stock’s price increases steadily over time with relatively small fluctuations.
    - It would have a **low standard deviation**, indicating that even though the stock is rising, it is doing so in a smooth and predictable manner.
