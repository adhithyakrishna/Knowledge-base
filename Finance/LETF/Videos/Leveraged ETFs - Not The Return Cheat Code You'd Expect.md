### Summary
The video explains the concept of leveraged ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), which aim to amplify the returns of an underlying index using borrowed money or derivatives. While these financial instruments can provide increased short-term gains, they come with significant risks, especially for long-term investors.

### Key Points:
1. **Leveraged ETFs Overview**: ^09b72e
    - These funds can double or triple the returns of an index through leverage.
    - They are popular among short-term traders and can enhance profits from small daily market movements.
2. **Mechanism of Leverage**:
    - Financial leverage allows investors to achieve higher returns with less capital.
    - They might use borrowed money or derivatives like options and futures to enhance returns.
3. **Risks Involved**:
    - Leveraged ETFs ***carry a negative return*** bias over the long term. This means that despite the market rising, these funds can still yield losses.
    - They reset their leverage daily, which can cause significant discrepancies between the ETF's performance and the underlying index over time.
4. **Real-World Consequences**:
    - The narrator illustrates this with an example where both a standard and a leveraged S&P 500 ETF are impacted by market fluctuations. Even if the market rebounds, the leveraged ETF may not return to break-even due to the compounding effect of losses.
    - If markets experience volatility, a leveraged ETF may incur greater losses, resulting in a higher probability of total loss.
5. **Conclusion**:
    - Leveraged ETFs can be beneficial for short-term trading but are generally advised against for long-term investing due to their complexity and inherent risks.
    - Investing in leveraged ETFs might transform a calculated investment into a high-risk gamble.
The video emphasizes caution for those considering leveraged ETFs, particularly for long-term investment strategies. ^5df4a6

### Math behind the Leveraged ETF
- Initial investment of 100 $. 
- If the market falls by 10%, the value will decrease to 90$ for S&P 500 and 70$ for LETF.
- To recover, it is enough for **11.1% increase in index** to bring the value back to 100 for S&P 500. For LETF to recover back, the index has to increase by **14.3%** to bring the value back to 100. AKA [[Volatility drag]]

#### Takeaway
- Even if the index of S&P dips and breaks back to even, the LETF is still going to be in red.
- Negative returns are always more impactful than positive returns on a per unit basis. A 20 percentage decrease followed by a 20 percentage increase will still leave you in net negative position. With LETF you'd compound the negative decline that S&P index faces. [06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=409&v=WoYVmlOxwbA)
- After the dip and recovery of S&P index to pre-pandemic levels, the LETF was still down by **-32.7%**.
- If market dipped by -34% a day the 3x LETF will become **zero.** The Longer you hold the ETF the likelihood of facing a dip is high.
- Market volatility impacts the LETF. If the Index rises by 2% and decreases by -1.9%, the S&P500 will have a slow growth but LETF will loose money overtime.
