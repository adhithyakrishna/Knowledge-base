### Summary
The video from Wall Street Millennial discusses an investment strategy that has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade: the Direction Daily S&P 500 Bull 3X Shares ETF (SPXL).

### Key Points
1. **Performance Comparison**: Since 2008, a 100 investment in SPY (the S&P 500 ETF) would have grown to approximately 570, while the same investment in SPXL would be worth about $2,700.
    
2. **Understanding SPXL**: SPXL seeks to achieve 300% of the ***daily performance*** of the S&P 500. It utilizes leverage through financial derivatives like **swap agreements and futures contracts** but doesn't own the actual stocks.
    
3. **Leverage and Fees**: SPXL has a management fee of 0.75% and total expenses capped at 1.01%. While these fees can reduce overall returns, the fund has still outperformed the underlying index due to its leverage. The Fees are deducted from the net asset value (NAV) of the fund in daily basis.
    
4. **Risks of Leveraged ETFs**: The video raises concerns about the pitfalls of leveraged ETFs over longer periods. Due to **daily rebalancing, these funds can dramatically underperform in volatile markets**, as shown in historical examples such as the Great Depression.
    
5. **Diversification Strategy**: The video suggests that investors can mitigate risks through a dollar-cost averaging strategy, where they invest a fixed amount periodically rather than all at once. This approach could significantly improve returns even during market downturns.
    
6. **Long-term Viability**: While SPXL can yield high returns during bull markets, it also carries the risk of substantial losses in bear markets. Investors should be prudent and consider their financial situation and risk tolerance when thinking about such volatile investments.
    

In conclusion, the video emphasizes that while leveraged ETFs like SPXL can provide impressive returns in favorable conditions, they are inherently risky and should be approached cautiously, particularly by long-term investors.


### Why daily rebalancing is not an inherently money-losing process
- Martingale property states that **the expected value of your future outcomes, given all past outcomes, will always be equal to your current value**.
- Example:
	- Setup
		- You start with **$0**.
		- If the coin lands **heads**, you win **$1**.
		- If the coin lands **tails**, you lose **$1**.
		- After you’ve flipped heads **three times**, you’re at **$3**.
		- Now, the expected future value, based on the next flip, is still **$3** (since you're at $3 right now). 
	- Reason:
		- The next flip is still **random** (you don't have any certainty that the next flip will be heads or tails).
		- **If you flip heads** again, you’ll go to **$4**.
		- **If you flip tails**, you’ll drop to **$2**.
		- But, **on average**, your expected value for the next flip (given the current situation) is still **$3** because: 0.5×4+0.5×2=3
- Conclusion:
	- **Daily rebalancing of leveraged ETFs is not inherently a losing process** but can lead to **underperformance over the long term** due to volatility drag.
	- The **Optional Stopping Theorem** does not apply to leveraged ETFs in the way suggested. Leveraged ETFs involve **compounding**, **path dependency**, and **volatility drag**, which violate the martingale assumptions needed for OST to hold.
	- Leveraged ETFs tend to have **higher expense ratios** than traditional ETFs due to the costs associated with the daily rebalancing, derivatives, and leverage. This **adds to the drag** on the performance of the ETF, especially over time.
	- **Expected returns of leveraged ETFs** are not guaranteed to be a simple multiple of the underlying index's return over long periods due to the effects of **compounding and volatility**.

### Important Takeaways
- The returns are highly dependent on when you initiate the position.
- Investing before the great depression would have wiped out the entire 100% of the initial investment.
- If someone had invested in 2008, a investment return of 23% would have been made during the post recession recovery.
- 3x LETF can outperform more than 3x during the bull run. But during the bear market it will almost bankrupt its investors.
- Diversification also means when you enter an investment - Diversification by time.
-  Investing 100$ each year into the 3x daily leveraged S&P500 starting 1927 would have earned **13 million by 2021** accounting the great depression (which would have bankrupted an onetime investment) and expense ratio + management fees compared to less than 0.5 million in just S&P 500.
