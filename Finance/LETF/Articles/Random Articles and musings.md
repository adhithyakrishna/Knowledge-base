#### How rebalancing works
Leveraged funds rebalance (generally) every single day. 
So you give them 100 dollars and they go get 200 dollars of exposure. If the thing goes up "10%" your 100 becomes 120, because that 200 dollars of exposure goes up 10% (to 220), minus the liability of the leverage (-100).

Tomorrow, you have 120 bucks in the thing, and now the fund needs 240 dollars of exposure. So every singley day they rebalance the actual exposure of the fund so that individual day's return will be precisely 2X.

If you hold it for more than a day, your returns are wildly path dependant. If the underlying is very boring and low vol, you will do much better than 2X over longer time periods. Any significant day to day vol and you will do much worse than 2X over longer time periods.

### Trading on margin vs Trading on Leveraged ETF

**Trading on Margin:**
- You borrow money from your broker to increase your purchasing power.
- You are directly responsible for managing the risk.
- If the value of your investments declines significantly, you may receive a "[[margin call]]" â€“ a demand to deposit more funds to maintain the required level of collateral.
- **Risk:** You can lose more money than you initially invested (potentially even more than your initial investment plus the borrowed amount).
**Leveraged ETFs:**
- These ETFs aim to deliver amplified returns (or losses) compared to the underlying asset.
- The fund itself uses leverage (borrowing) to achieve this.
- **Risk:**
    - **ETF Closure:** If the fund's performance deteriorates significantly, the issuer may be forced to close it down. This can lead to significant losses for investors.
    - **Daily Reset:** Leveraged ETFs are designed to achieve their leverage target daily. This can lead to significant losses, especially during periods of market volatility or prolonged downturns, even if the underlying asset eventually recovers.
**Summary:**
- Margin trading places the direct burden of risk management on the investor.
- Leveraged ETFs shift some of the risk to the ETF issuer, but they carry unique risks associated with their leveraged structure, such as daily resets and the possibility of fund closure.
