Forecasting brings an infamous 50% mistake rate and reading the financial tapestry provides a false sense of taking control of their money. Forecasting brings an infamous 50% mistake rate.

### The portfolio

**The 3% Signal —** This conservative “3Sig” plan is the epitome of prudence, for risk-averse investors who still want to beat the market over time. It uses the IJR small-cap stock fund and a general bond fund.

**The 6% Signal —** Adding a dash of boldness, “6Sig” combines the MVV mid-cap leveraged stock fund with a general bond fund.

**The 9% Signal —** Sitting atop the aggression scale, “9Sig” serves investors who are willing to ride out high volatility in exchange for high performance. It’s powered by the dynamic TQQQ Nasdaq 100 leveraged stock fund alongside a general bond fund.

#### How to rebalance
- Rebalancing the stock fund to a percentage growth target each quarter. It is more effective because it adjusts the size of its buys and sells based on the size of the price change.
- If stock-fund prices rise a little, these plans sell a little. If they rise a lot, they sell a lot — and vice versa when buying.
- This is a variation of value averaging.


### Notes from research
Jason Kelley the author of this article has written a book -   [The 3% Signal: The Investing Technique That Will Change Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/3-Signal-Investing-Technique-Change/dp/0142180955/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8). The following review speaks about [[Value Investing]].

#### Critical reviews about the book
##### Review 1
-  I think that the claims regarding the strategy as "revolutionary" and "new" are misleading. There is a clear marketing ploy by giving this "plan" a catchy name to further continue the facade.
##### Review 2
**1. Sensitivity to Market Conditions:**
- **Over-reliance on Recent Bear Markets:** The system's success seems heavily influenced by the specific market conditions of 2000-2013, characterized by two significant bear markets followed by strong recoveries.
- **Potential Underperformance in Bull Markets:** If implemented at the beginning of a prolonged bull market, the 3% Signal might lead to underinvestment in stocks for extended periods, missing out on significant gains.
- **Vulnerability in Prolonged Bear Markets:** Conversely, in a prolonged and severe bear market, the system could force continued investment in stocks, potentially leading to substantial losses and significant emotional distress for the investor.

**2. High Cash Reserves and Underinvestment:**
- **Significant Cash Drag:** The system requires substantial cash reserves (in this case, $12,241 for an initial $10,000 investment), meaning only a small portion of the total capital is actively invested in the market (36%).
- **Limited Upside Potential:** This underinvestment can significantly limit potential gains during bull markets, especially long-term ones.

**3. Psychological Challenges:**
- **Emotional Toll of Bear Markets:** The system may be particularly challenging during prolonged bear markets, requiring consistent investment in declining assets, which can be emotionally draining and potentially lead to significant losses.
- **Doubt and Anxiety:** The need for large cash reserves and the potential for underperformance in different market conditions can create significant anxiety and doubt for investors.

**In essence:**
The 3% Signal method, while potentially effective in certain market conditions, presents several key challenges:

- **Sensitivity to market cycles:** Its performance can vary significantly depending on the prevailing market conditions.
- **High cash reserves:** The requirement for substantial cash reserves limits potential upside and can be psychologically demanding.
- **Emotional burden:** The system may be emotionally challenging to implement, especially during prolonged bear markets.
#### Excerpts on value investing from one of the review
Now, once you have decided to go with index investing (smart choice), the next decision is how you will manage the money in your plan. There are 3 well-established methods for this.  
  
1) Depositing a large chunk of new funds at random times (lump-sum investing)  
2) Depositing equal amounts of the large chunk at regular intervals (dollar-cost averaging)  
3) Depositing funds into a "safety bucket" at regular intervals (value averaging)

[[Value Averaging]] is probably the least known of the 3 methods and has been described as "the closest thing to consistently buying low and selling high". The key difference between value averaging and the other 2 is in the method of rebalancing.

With lump-sum investing and dollar cost averaging, the portfolio is set at a fixed allocation ratio between stocks and bonds and the performance of the portfolio is then at the whims of the market. With value averaging, the opposite is true. The performance of the portfolio is set at a fixed target and the ratio of stocks to bonds is then at the whims of the market. In both cases, you rebalance by selling or buying stocks and bonds. With **value averaging** the rebalancing is often done more frequently.

Indeed, it shows that value investing works best with high volatility as the 3% Signal author suggests. This makes intuitive sense, since you will make money by selling at higher highs, thus making more profit. On top of this, you will be buying new shares at lower lows. This combination ensures that you make more and pay less.

The major shortfall I see with the plan is using it within a **Roth IRA, which has a limit on annual contributions**. Therefore, it is conceivable that you could find yourself in a bear market with the inability to buy more because you have used up all of your bond funds and are unable to add additional funds to the account due to government regulations. I would only ever use this in a tax-advantaged account because the **frequent selling could add up with short-term capital gains taxes**.
