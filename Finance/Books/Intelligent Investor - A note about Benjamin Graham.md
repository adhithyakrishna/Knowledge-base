#### Core principles of investing
- **Stocks represent real businesses:**
    - Focus on the underlying value of the business, not just the stock price.
- **Market cycles are cyclical:**
    - Sell during periods of optimism (high prices) and buy during pessimism (low prices).
    - ***Unsustainable optimism*** - Stocks become to expensive
    - Unjustified pessimism - Stocks become less expensive
    - The intelligent investor is a realist who ***sells to optimists and buys from pessimists***.
- **Price significantly impacts returns:**
    - Higher purchase prices lead to lower potential returns.
- **Risk of being wrong is inevitable:**
    - Employ a "margin of safety" to minimize losses.
    - “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to be.
- **Develop your own investment philosophy:**
    - Become a critical thinker, independent of market sentiment.
    - Invest with patience confidence.
    - Develop discipline and courage to refuse other people's mood swings govern your financial destiny.
    - Focus on your own behavior, not just market fluctuations.

#### Investors vs Speculators
- **Investors** focus on the underlying value of a company or asset.
    - They aim to buy at a price below the intrinsic value (the true worth of the company).
    - Their primary concern is the long-term health and profitability of the business.
    - They are less concerned with short-term price fluctuations and market noise.

- **Speculators** primarily focus on short-term price movements.
    - They aim to profit from anticipated price changes, often based on market trends, rumors, or short-term events.
    - They may not be as concerned with the fundamental value of the underlying asset.
    - Their approach often involves higher risk and potential for greater volatility in returns.
