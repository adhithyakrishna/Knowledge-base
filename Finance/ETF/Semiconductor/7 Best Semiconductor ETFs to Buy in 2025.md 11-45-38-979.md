## VanEck Semiconductor ETF ([SMH](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/technology/vaneck-semiconductor-etf/smh))

"The potential benefits of investing in semiconductor ETFs include exposure to a high-growth sector with strong fundamentals, diversification across multiple companies in the industry and the potential for long-term capital appreciation," says Sean August, CEO of the August Wealth Management Group. The largest ETF in this segment is SMH, which currently has $24.5 billion in assets under management (AUM).

This ETF tracks the MVIS **U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index**, which focuses on the largest and most liquid U.S. companies that generate at least 50% of their revenues from semiconductors. Because the ETF has the potential to get very top-heavy when certain semiconductor stocks like Nvidia outperform, there's a 20% weight cap on individual holdings. SMH charges a 0.35% expense ratio.

VanEck Semiconductor ETF seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index. The index includes common stocks and depositary receipts of U.S. exchange-listed companies in the semiconductor industry. Such companies may include medium-capitalization companies and foreign companies that are listed on a U.S. exchange. The fund is non-diversified.
#### Summary
- Expense ratio - 0.35%
- 52 Week Range 184.15 - 283.07
- PE Ratio (TTM) 37.75
- Volume 5,115,926
- YTD - 6.90%
- NAV - 261.58

## iShares Semiconductor ETF ([SOXX](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/technology/ishares-semiconductor-etf/soxx))

"When looking for semiconductor ETFs, investors should consider factors such as the expense ratio, the underlying index or benchmark, the fund's holdings and diversification strategy, and the ETF's historical performance," August says. "It is also important to assess the fund's liquidity and trading volume to ensure that it is easy to buy and sell." SMH’s main competitor, SOXX fits this bill.

This ETF is smaller than SMH, with $14.6 billion in AUM, but is by no means undercapitalized. It tracks the NYSE Semiconductor Index, a benchmark of the 30 largest U.S.-listed semiconductor stocks. SOXX is a popular pick for traders thanks to its [options chain](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/options) that features a variety of expiration dates and strike prices. It is also fairly liquid, with a minimal 0.03% 30-day median bid-ask spread.

iShares Semiconductor ETF seeks to track the investment results of the ICE Semiconductor Index composed of U.S. equities in the semiconductor sector. The fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of its index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents. The fund is non-diversified.
#### Summary
- Expense Ratio - 0.35%
- 52 Week Range 192.87 - 267.24
- PE Ratio (TTM) 33.89
- Volume 2,226,965
- YTD - 7.03%

## Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF ([SOXQ](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/technology/invesco-phlx-semiconductor-etf/soxq))

"While certain segments of the semiconductor market, like **memory, may be facing near-term pressure** due to oversupply concerns, the longer-term growth potential driven by advancements in AI, autonomous driving and high-performance computing remains strong," says Rene Reyna, head of thematic and specialty product ETF strategy at Invesco. Invesco's offering here is SOXQ.

This semiconductor ETF's main strength is low fees. Whereas SMH and SOXX both charge a 0.35% expense ratio**, SOXQ undercuts both at 0.19%.** For a $10,000 investment, that's $35 in annual fees versus $19. This ETF also tracks a fairly notable semiconductor benchmark: **the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index.** Investors get exposure to 30 large, market-cap **weighted U.S. semiconductor companies**.

The Fund and the Index are reconstituted annually in September and rebalanced quarterly in March, June, September and December.

Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF seeks to track the investment results (before fees and expenses) of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index . The fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the underlying index. Strictly in accordance with its guidelines and mandated procedures, Nasdaq compiles the underlying index, which is a modified market-capitalization weighted index designed to measure the performance of the 30 largest companies listed in the United States that are engaged in the semiconductor business, as determined by the index Provider. The fund is non-diversified.

#### Summary
- Expense ratio - 0.19%
- 52 Week range $33.25 - $46.82
- PE ratio - 30.69
- Forward PE ratio - 23.05
- Volume - 255,546
- YTD - 6.30%

## Invesco Semiconductors ETF ([PSI](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/technology/invesco-semiconductors-etf/psi))

"Having broad exposure to the semiconductor ecosystem via an ETF allows investors to capture these growth opportunities while helping navigate the cyclical nature of the industry," Reyna says. **Investors looking to outperform SOXQ may find PSI an attractive alternative**. This ETF tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, which uses a "smart beta" approach to screening stocks.

Instead of just picking the largest and most liquid semiconductor companies, PSI uses fundamentals-based criteria. The ETF evaluates **30 prospective holdings based on [price momentum](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/momentum-investing), earnings momentum, quality, management action and value.** However, the use of an advanced index results in higher fees. **Compared to SOXQ, PSI is significantly pricier, with a 0.56% expense ratio.**  

##### Summary
- The expense ratio is 0.56%
- 52 Week range is $46.60 - $67.33
- P/E ratio is 30.53
- Forward P/E ratio is 32.01
- YTD - 7.73%
- Volume - 66,634

## First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF ([FTXL](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/technology/first-trust-nasdaq-semiconductor-etf/ftxl))

PSI isn't the only semiconductor ETF to use an advanced index methodology. Its main competitor is FTXL, which tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Smart Semiconductor Index. **This ETF screens semiconductor stocks based on return on assets, gross income and momentum.** Instead of market-cap weighting holdings, FTXL weights stocks based on their trailing-12-months cash flow and rebalances semiannually.

FTXL's index criteria is theoretically sound, but the execution has been less than perfect due to higher turnover and a pricey 0.6% expense ratio. Over the trailing five-year period, the ETF has returned an annualized 16.9%. This seems impressive but is less so when you consider the l**ess complicated Nasdaq U.S. Benchmark Semiconductors Index returned an annualized 38.3%.**

First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the fund's fees and expenses) of the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor IndexTM. The fund invests at least 90% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in the common stocks and depository receipts that comprise the index. The index is designed to provide exposure to U.S. companies comprising the semiconductor sector that have been selected based upon their liquidity and weighted based upon their cumulative score on three investing factors: volatility, value and growth. It is non-diversified.

#### Summary
- NAV - $93.50
- 52 week average - 79.89 to 107.11
- Number of holdings - 31
- Volume - 60,800
- YTD - 6.15%
- PE Ratio (TTM) - 31.46
- Expense ratio - 0.6%

## SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF ([XSD](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/technology/spdr-s-p-semiconductor-etf/xsd))

- **Market-cap weighted semiconductor ETFs like SMH and SOXX prioritize the larger companies, making them top-heavy.** 
- **On the other hand, smart-beta semiconductor ETFs like PSI and FTXL use fundamental screeners to construct their portfolios.** 
- **A third alternative is [equal-weighted](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/top-performing-equal-weight-etfs-to-buy) semiconductor ETFs, which can provide more balanced exposure with a higher proportion of small- and mid-cap companies.**

The ETF to use for this role is XSD, which tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index. At each quarterly rebalance cycle, each of XSD's 41 holdings is assigned an equal weight. This helps the ETF "buy low, sell high" in an objective and systematic manner. The top holdings in XSD tend to be whatever companies have outperformed in between rebalances. XSD charges a **0.35%** expense ratio.

SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of an index derived from the semiconductor segment of a U.S. total market composite index. In seeking to track the performance of the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index (the "index"), the fund employs a sampling strategy. It generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The index represents the semiconductors segment of the S&P Total Market Index ("S&P TMI").

#### Summary
YTD - 4.56%
Expense ratio - 0.35%
